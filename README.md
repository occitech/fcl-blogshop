Front-Commerce Lite - Thème Blogshop
*Prototype your next eCommerce experiences using modern web technologies.*

Front-Commerce is a React application with a GraphQL middleware for building eCommerce stores backed by existing headless platforms such as Magento2. [Learn more about the product.](https://developers.front-commerce.com/)

## Theme Blogshop - Overview
Our Blogshop theme aims to propose a user-centered representation of ecommerce. Nowadays, users want feedbacks and reviews about products they’re buying. They don’t follow the old marketing approach anymore. You have to convince them by giving them human feedbacks.

In our Blogshop theme, we’re giving a core place to the product description. With the power of storytelling, we can create awesome product stories, as you can see on the screenshot down below.
